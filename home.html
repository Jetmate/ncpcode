Never touched a computer before? Cry upon hearing that a Java class is mandatory for graduation? Well, you've come to the right place! At NCP Code, we'll teach coding completely from scratch, presenting the information in a simple, easy to understand format.</p><p>The key phrase here is <em>fun</em>. Coding is notorious for being the favorite pastime of 30 year olds who live in their mothers' basements, but we hope to prove otherwise. Not only is coding becoming a skill of interest for job applications, but it unlocks the potential for creation. Although many of us know Java, that's an example of a language that's boring and pedantic. At NCP Code, you'll learn genuinely exciting languages that will change how you see coding. Compare these two examples:</p><div><table id="table1"><tr><th>PYTHON (fun and easy)</th><th>JAVA (boring and pedantic)</th></tr><tr><td><pre>print('Hello World!')</pre></td><td><pre>public class Root {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print('Hello World!');
  }
}</pre></td></tr></table><table id="table2"><tr><th>PYTHON (fun and easy)</th><td><pre>print('Hello World!')</pre></td></tr><tr><th>JAVA (boring and pedantic)</th><td><pre>public class Root {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print('Hello World!');
  }
}</pre></td></tr></table></div><p><em>Not only can coding be fun and engaging, but it also looks great on an application.</em> The best way to discover the multifaceted world (and totally awesome community) of coding is to join in for yourself.</p><h2>Schedule and Format</h2><p>NCP Code meets every Tuesday in room 301 (3rd-floor computer lab). The meetings go from 3:15 to 4:30.</p><p>Each meeting will function as a mini-hackathon. This means that first you will be taught some coding-related topic, and then you will have the chance to test your understanding by spending about 30 minutes making something (no sweat, it's super informal; there's room for error). While this happens, you will receive constant advice and support from industry professionals who have years of experience. At the end of the hackathon, everyone will get a chance to (voluntarily) show off their creations.</p><p>If you aren't already hooked: <div id="food">WE WILL HAVE FREE FOOD!</div></p><h2>About</h2><p>NCP Code is run by high-schoolers like you!
