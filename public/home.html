At NCP Code, we'll teach the fun aspects of coding completely from scratch, presenting the information in a simple, easy to understand format.</p><p>The key phrase here is <em>fun</em> programming. Although many of us know Java, that's an example of a language that's boring and pedantic. At NCP Code, you'll learn genuinely exciting languages that will change how you see coding. Compare these two examples:</p><div><table id="table1"><tr><th>PYTHON (fun and easy)</th><th>JAVA (boring and pedantic)</th></tr><tr><td><pre>print("Hello World!") </pre></td><td><pre>public class Root {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("Hello World!");
  }
} </pre></td></tr></table><table id="table2"><tr><th>PYTHON (fun and easy)</th><td><pre>print("Hello World!")</pre></td></tr><tr><th>JAVA (boring and pedantic)</th><td><pre>public class Root {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("Hello World!");
  }
}</pre></td></tr></table></div><p><em>Coding is not as difficult and tiresome as it seems.</em> The only way to understand this is just to give it a chance.</p><h2>Schedule and Format</h2><p>NCP Code meets every Tuesday in room 301 (3rd-floor computer lab). The meetings go from 3:15 to 4:30. </p><p>Each meeting will function as a mini-hackathon. This means that first you will be taught some coding-related topic, and then you will have the chance to test your understanding by spending about 30 minutes making something. While this happens, you will receive constant advice and support from industry professionals who have years of experience. At the end of the hackathon, everyone will get a chance to (voluntarily) show of their creations.</p><p>We also have free food!</p><h2>About</h2><p>NCP Code is run by high-schoolers like you!
